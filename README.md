# Python Learning Project

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to learn more about Python, including functions, classes, and exploring new data. This project is a side project for school to help deepen understanding of Python programming.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and editing code.
- **GitHub**: Version control through VS Code for managing the project.

## Key Features
- Exploring Python and expanding knowledge of Python programming.
- Using Python functions and classes to solve various problems and create modules.
- Planning to add Pygame for creating simple games in the future.

## Cloning the Project
To clone this project, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/007snoop/Adventure-Game.git
    ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   *(Note: As of now, there are no external dependencies. This will be updated when Pygame or other libraries are added.)*

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python main_game.py
    ```
   *(main_game.py may end up being UPDATED at some point to house a GUI instead of a terminal interface.)*
